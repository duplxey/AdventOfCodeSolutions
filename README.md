These are my solutions for AdventOfCode 2019 (they might not be optimal). This repository was made just for fun. ðŸ˜ƒ

## What is AdventOfCode?
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.
